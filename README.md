## My process

Step 1: I started by analyzing the design image and coming up with a plan on how i should approach things with HTML and CSS.
I ended up creating containers for the elements in need for easy use of flexbox. 

Step 2: Once HTML built with containers and classes and semantics, i started working on the CSS.

Step 3: Once i had the layout done i started working from top to bottom on smaller details, such as font sizes and colors.

Step 4: As with responsiveness i started with desktop first. Then i started to work on mobile media query and got it working.

Step 5: Thats it! Done.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned to use media queries as i had close to none experience with them beforehand. 
Very useful skill.


### Continued development

I would like to learn more about aria attributes and how to make a website accessible for all kinds of people.
